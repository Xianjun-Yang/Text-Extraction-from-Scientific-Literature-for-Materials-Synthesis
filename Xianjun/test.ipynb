The manufacturing of an all-Zintl module is particularly attractive for practical applications, as it alleviates concerns regarding the electronic, thermal, and mechanical compatibility of the p- and n-type legs. To date, a large majority of Zintl phases have been realized as p-type TE materials. Our recent discovery of n-type transport in Ba-doped KAlSb4 and KGaSb4 has helped demonstrate the potential of n-type Zintl thermo- electrics. In this paper, we report the experimental discovery of 4 ABX4 Zintl phases: RbAlSb4, RbGaSb4, CsAlSb4, and CsGaSb4. Transport measurements on Ba-doped RbGaSb4 and CsGaSb4 demonstrate near glassy lattice thermal conductivity (<0.5 W m−1 K−1, 350 °C) and lightly doped n-type transport. However, the doping eﬃciency of Ba in RbGaSb4 and CsGaSb4 is signiﬁcantly impeded when compared to our prior work on KGaSb4. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we performed ﬁrst-principles defect calculations and found that the eﬀect of compensating alkali metal vacancies increases in the Rb- and Cs-based analogues. Considering the TE potential of the known ABX4 n-type materials, we have also performed a computational survey over 27 plausible compositions where A = (K, Rb, Cs), B = (Al, Ga, In), and X = (As, Sb, Bi) to investigate the eﬀect of chemistry on potential TE performance. KEYWORDS: n-type Zintl, n-type thermoelectric, defect calculations, doping\\n', ' ■ INTRODUCTION\\n', ' The discovery of high-performance thermoelectric materials is a complex process, due in part to the interdependent nature of electron and phonon transport processes.1 The same scattering phenomena that create low thermal conductivity often hinder electronic transport and force a reduction in the electronic mobility. A long-standing challenge in thermoelectrics is the discovery of materials that circumvent this paradigm. In this respect, the Zintl phases are uniquely suited for thermoelectric applications.2−4 Despite inherently low (near glassy) lattice thermal conductivity, Zintls often maintain respectable electronic transport. Such a unique prospect has even prompted the concept of the phonon-glass electron-crystal (PGEC) concept within thermoelectrics.5\\n', ' Zintl phases have been recognized as a promising class of thermoelectric materials since the 1990s. Many technologically relevant thermoelectrics are Zintl phases, whose structural diversity can range from the clathrates (e.g., Ba8Ga16Ge30),6−15 interstitially ﬁlled skutterudites (e.g., CeCo4Sb12)16−25 and complex rare-earth/alkali-earth-containing networks (e.g., Yb14MnSb11).26−36 The continued success of these materials has culminated in the development of Zintl-based radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTG) for deep-space power applications.37 However, the design of eﬀective and reliable\\n', ' modules depends heavily on the chemical, mechanical, and electrical compatibility of the diﬀerent thermoelectric seg- ments. A persistent problem has been the relative scarcity of n- type Zintl compounds, as the vast majority of Zintl materials present as p-type semiconductors. Computational searches for high-eﬃciency n-type thermoelectric materials have historically neglected dopability metrics. Subsequently, computational predictions have often been challenging to realize exper- imentally (e.g., LiZnSb).38,39 Recent computational studies even suggest that the majority of the well-studied Zintl phases may be fated to exhibit p-type transport regardless of doping or growth conditions.40 Even the advent of phase-boundary mapping41−44 may be powerless to realize equilibrium n-type transport in many of the Zintl materials due to the facile formation of alkali and alkali earth metal vacancies.

Our discovery of n-type transport and good performance (zT ∼ 1, 350−400 °C) in Ba-doped KAlSb4 and Ba-doped KGaSb4 helped to demonstrate the potential of other n-type Zintl phases.46,47 Despite being discovered in the early 1990s, these materials had seen little characterization eﬀorts beyond X-ray diﬀraction.49,50\\n', ' In this work, we present the experimental discovery of four new Zintl materials, RbAlSb4, RbGaSb4, CsAlSb4, and CsGaSb4. The materials were synthesized as polycrystalline powders and characterized via high-resolution synchrotron X- ray diﬀraction. Structures were solved from the powder patterns using charge ﬂipping methods and were found to be isostructural to KAlSb4 and KGaSb4. Rietveld reﬁnements trends between ABX4 allowed us to compare structural compounds with varying alkali (K, Rb, Cs) and group 13 (Al, Ga) atoms. For transport measurements, we chose to concentrate on the Ga-series of compounds, although we expect results to generalize to the Al-based analogues. Similar to our work on KGaSb4, we doped samples of KGaSb4, RbGaSb4, and CsGaSb4 with 2.5% Ba, ﬁnding that all materials are n-type dopable. However, the Hall carrier concentration decreases signiﬁcantly between KGaSb4 (1019 e− cm−3), RbGaSb4 (1018 e− cm−3), and CsGaSb4 (1017 e− cm−3). Subsequent density functional theory calculations reveal that the formation of compensating alkali metal vacancies becomes increasingly favorable as the alkali metal transitions from K, Rb, and Cs, corroborating experimental Hall eﬀect measure- ments. While the thermal conductivity of the Ga-containing ABX4 Zintls remains exceptionally low (<0.5 W m−1 K−1, 350 °C), the variation in doping eﬃciency inspired us to consider alternate (hypothetical) compounds. To this end, we performed a computational survey over 27 ABX4 compositions where A = (K, Rb, Cs), B = (Al, Ga, In), and X = (As, Sb, Bi). The predicted transport results are tabulated, and the thermoelectric potential is evaluated through use of the quality\\n', ' factor β.■ METHODS\\n', ' Experimental Section. Samples of KAlSb4, KGaSb4, RbAlSb4, RbGaSb4, CsAlSb4, and CsGaSb4 were synthesized from elemental reagents: K (ingot, Alfa 99.8%), Rb (ingot, Alfa 99.75%), Cs (liquid, Alfa 99.98%), Al (shot, Alfa 99.999%), Ga (liquid, Alfa 99.99%), and Sb (shot, Alfa 99.999%). Due to the reactivity of alkali metal precursors, all sample preparation was performed in a nitrogen glovebox (oxygen <3 ppm, water <1 ppm). Elemental reagents were sealed into tungsten carbide vials and ball milled for 90 min in a Spex 8000D high-energy ball mill. Note that an additional 5% excess alkali metal was added to each synthesis (e.g., K1.05GaSb4). Synthesis of Ba- doped samples followed an identical procedure, except for the addition of 2.5% Ba (ingot, Alfa 99.8%) before milling. Note that, to maintain doping stoichiometry and excess alkali content, doped samples were synthesized according to (Ba0.025K0.975)1.05GaSb4.\\n', ' For structure determination, we sealed undoped, as-milled powders into fused silica ampules and annealed them at 550 °C for 48 h under vacuum.

Prior to use, the graphite die, plungers, and graphite foil liners were baked at 600 °C for a minimum of 30 min under dynamic vacuum. We loaded approximately 1.75 g of milled powder into the cooled die and transferred this to the hot press chamber. The chamber was evacuated to <5 mTorr and purged with argon to ∼0.75 atm thrice before the chamber was evacuated to <1 mTorr. A pressure of 25 MPa was applied to achieve a rough green body density before beginning the temperature proﬁle. The sample was densiﬁed at 550 °C under 15 MPa of pressure for 12 h and then cooled to room temperature at a controlled rate of 100 °C/h.

The prototype structure KAlSb4 and its isostruc- tural analogue KGaSb4 were originally reported by Cordier and Ochmann in the 1990s.49,50 However, despite their eﬀorts in analogous chemical spaces (e.g., discovery of Cs2GaSb2),64 they never reported Rb- or Cs-containing analogues to KAlSb4 or KGaSb4. Here, we report the discovery of RbAlSb4, RbGaSb4, CsAlSb4, and CsGaSb4. These phases were initially identiﬁed from laboratory X-ray diﬀraction, although we performed follow-up measurements at the Advanced Photon Source (APS 11-BM) for conﬁrmation. As internal references, we also included fresh samples of KGaSb4 and KAlSb4 in our experiments. Direct structure solution using charge ﬂipping methods conﬁrms that RbAlSb4, RbGaSb4, CsAlSb4, and CsGaSb4 crystallize in the KAlSb4 structure type. All diﬀraction experiments, alongside the reﬁned results, can be found in the SI, Figures S1−S6.\\n', ' Figure 1a exhibits the crystal structure of the ABX4 Zintl phases. The features are generally reminiscent of other tunnel- like Zintl materials (e.g., BaGa2Sb2,35,48 Ba3Ga4Sb5,65 66), although the AlSb/GaSb networks in the Ba4In8Sb16 ABX4 Zintls form double tunnels of alkali metal ions that extend in the b-direction. The tunnel walls are tiled in a herringbone-like pattern (Pnma space group) in the ac-plane. The AlSb/GaSb polyanionic framework contains four unique Sb sites and three unique types of Sb coordination. Extending as inﬁnite chains into the page, we ﬁnd (1) AlSb4/GaSb4 corner-sharing tetrahedra, (2) Sb−Sb zigzag chains, and (3) Sb−Sb trigonal pyramidal chains. As Zintl compounds generally maintain semiconducting charge balance, all Sb atoms in this structure contain lone pairs.\\n', ' Figure 1b shows a isolated representation of the ABX4 double tunnel structure. The colors indicate the structural changes as we transition between KGaSb4 (black), RbGaSb4 (blue), and CsGaSb4 (red). The Al-series is qualitatively identical.

This appears to be consistent ∼ 1.9 Å2) with related compounds. Consider KGaSb4 (Beq compared to the chemically related compounds KGaSb2 (Beq ∼ 2.2−3.1 Å2), and K2GaSb2 ∼ 2.7−3.7 Å2), K2GaSb3 (Beq ∼ 1.8−2.5 Å2).67−69 These values are also comparable to (Beq the B e q of K-containing type-II (e.g., ∼ 1.5 Å2).70 It is important to keep in K2Ba14Ga30Sn106, Beq mind, however, that these measurements were performed on powders. Furthermore, the structure is clearly anisotropic, and the isotropic thermal parameters may not adequately describe complex Zintl phases.\\n', ' clathrates\\n', ' Due to the high resolution of APS 11-BM, we resolved a slight anomaly which is not observable by laboratory X-ray diﬀraction. Many peaks display slight asymmetry or shoulder peaks which cannot be modeled by microstructural or fundamental parameter peak shapes. The pattern appears as though two slightly diﬀerent lattice parameters are present for a single compound. An exhaustive search for a new space group or crystal system yielded no results that outperform the original prototype. Changes in processing had a minimal eﬀect on the anomaly, and the eﬀect persisted between batches synthesized independently. Calibration standards from APS conﬁrm no beamline issues, and reﬂections cannot be ascribed to impurities. We suspect that ABX4 powders are more reactive than they initially appear. While samples were synthesized entirely under nitrogen, transport to APS was performed in sealed Kapton capillaries. Spurious oxidation of samples would vary depending on Kapton permeability and seal quality. For this data set, KAlSb4, KGaSb4, RbAlSb4, CsAlSb4, and CsGaSb4 show a minimal eﬀect and need no special attention. RbGaSb4 shows signiﬁcant peak asymmetry and requires additional ﬁtting; details can be found alongside Figure S4. The anomaly does not aﬀect the conclusions derived from the diﬀraction data and would not be resolved outside of synchrotron sources. Considering that KAlSb4 and KGaSb4 showed potential as n- type Zintl thermoelectrics, the next natural step is to dope the new ABX4 materials and determine their amenability to n-type doping.\\n', ' Experimental Doping of ABX4 Zintls with Ba. Both KAlSb4 and KGaSb4 were dopable to approximately 2 × 1019 e− cm−3 with Ba. Solid solutions with Ba were noted up to approximately 2% substitution on the alkali site (e.g., in the electronic K0.98Ba0.02GaSb4). Monotonic changes properties (Seebeck coeﬃcient, electrical resistivity, Hall eﬀect) were observed, conﬁrming successful doping.46,47 Both materials showed good thermoelectric performance, nearing zT ∼ 1 at 400 °C with minimal optimization. For this paper, we have opted to restrict the scope of additional experiments to the Ga-based compounds, as they tend to outperform the Al-based materials. However, we expect the results to generalize to the Al-based compounds.\\n', ' All undoped ABX4 Zintls present as intrinsic semiconductors with high electrical resistivity, low carrier concentration, and bipolar Seebeck coeﬃcients. To assess the n-type dopability of the new ABX4 materials, we doped RbGaSb4 and CsGaSb4 with 2.5% Ba. A fresh sample of Ba-doped KGaSb4 was also included as an internal reference sample. At these concen- trations, we see evidence of a Ba-rich impurity phase, indicating saturation of the Ba solubility in the ABX4 phase.

Measurements shown include both heating and cooling data.\\n', ' 2185\\n', ' Figure 2. (a) Hall eﬀect measurements on 2.5% Ba-doped samples of KGaSb4, RbGaSb4, and CsGaSb4 reveal that all materials are n-type dopable with Ba. However, the doping eﬃciency of Ba falls oﬀ dramatically as we transition from KGaSb4 (1.1 × 1019 e− cm−3, 350 °C), to RbGaSb4 (2.7 × 1018 e− cm−3, 350 °C), to CsGaSb4 (3.0 × 1017 e− cm−3, 350 °C). (b) Electrical resistivity measurements track changes in the Hall carrier concentration. However, resistivity also shows temperature-activated behavior independent of the carrier concentration, presumed to be caused by oxidation at grain boundaries.\\n', ' The most dramatic changes are observed in the Sb and Al/ Ga atoms which most closely coordinate the alkali metal tunnels. Geometrically, this causes a signiﬁcant increase in the cross-sectional area of the tunnel structure. In fact, expansion within the ac-directions (cross-sectional) far outstrips that of the b-direction (along tunnel). From KGaSb4 (774.06 Å3, a = 10.347 Å, b = 4.201 Å, c = 17.807 Å) to RbGaSb4 (808.15 Å3, a = 10.525 Å, b = 4.210 Å, c = 18.104 Å), the a- and c-directions expand approximately 1.7% whereas the b-direction expands only by 0.2%. Similarly, for the transition between RbGaSb4 and CsGaSb4 (836.07 Å3, a = 10.742 Å, b = 4.219 Å, c = 18.448 Å), the a-direction expands 2.1%; c expands 1.9%, and b expands only 0.2%. The cell volume increases monotonically with increasing alkali metal size and decreases when Ga is substituted for Al. These observations are consistent with the increasing ionic radii of the alkali metals (K, Rb, Cs) and the decreasing covalent radii of the group 13 metals (Al, Ga).\\n', ' At room temperature, the thermal parameters for the alkali metal ions seem typical for related Zintl phases. For all ABX4 Zintls studied here, the isotropic thermal parameter (Beq)\\n', ' Figure 3. Native defect formation enthalpies (ΔHD,q) are shown as a function of the Fermi level (EF) for (a) K-rich KGaSb4, (b) Rb-rich RbGaSb4, and (c) Cs-rich CsGaSb4. Alkali metal vacancies (red lines) are the lowest-energy acceptor defects while antisite SbGa defects (brown lines) are the lowest-energy donor defects. EF is referenced to the valence band maximum such that EF values range from 0 to the band gap energy Eg. Multiple lines of the same color represent the same defect type at diﬀerent crystallographic sites. The relatively high formation energy of acceptor cation vacancies facilitates extrinsic n-type doping. ΔEDon represents the energy window for extrinsic n-type doping.\\n', ' Our previous results on Ba-doped KGaSb4 found that the Hall carrier concentration saturates at approximately 2.1 × 1019 e− cm−3 at 400 °C. This agrees well with the present study, where Ba-doped KGaSb4 saturates near 1.1 × 1019 e− cm−3 at 350 °C. The reduced temperatures in this work are to avoid sublimation of RbGaSb4 and CsGaSb4 at high temperatures. The qualitative trend for KGaSb4 also tracks our previous publication well, showing a Hall carrier concentration that decreases with temperature. We do not observe any hysteresis during thermal cycling of the ABX4 samples below 350 °C, so we do not suspect permanent loss of the alkali metal as a contributing factor to the decreasing carrier concentration. Instead, this observation may be explained by the thermal activation of compensating defects (e.g., alkali metal vacancies), nonparabolicity of the bands, or energy-dependent electron scattering rates that evolve with temperature.\\n', ' The electronic resistivity exhibits two eﬀects: (1) increasing resistivity due to decreased doping eﬃciency moving from KGaSb4, RbGaSb4, to CsGaSb4, and (2) decreasing resistivity with temperature. The general changes in the order of magnitude of the resistivity trend sensibly with changes in doping eﬃciency of Ba. However, the decreasing resistivity with temperature requires some explanation. As noted in previous publications, many Zintl phases show high room- temperature resistivity. The thermally activated behavior is often attributed to oxidation at grain boundaries and has been observed in Ca3AlSb3, Sr3AlSb3, Sr3GaSb3, and KAlSb4.31−34,47 intensive reﬁnement of processing We have shown that procedures can reduce the eﬀect, although it is diﬃcult to fully eliminate it.46 This is consistent with our hypothesis regarding the potential compositional inhomogeneity in X-ray results.\\n', ' While RbGaSb4 and CsGaSb4 are successfully doped n-type with substitution of Ba, the doping eﬃciency is signiﬁcantly reduced when compared to KGaSb4.

To provide insight into the n-type dopability of KGaSb4, RbGaSb4, and CsGaSb4, we turn to ﬁrst-principles defect calculations. Focusing on the native defects, Figure 3a−c summarizes the calculated defect formation enthalpies. For consistency, all calculations were performed under alkali-rich conditions. While the alkali metal chemical potential is maximized, the formation of alkali vacancies is suppressed, which is conducive for minimizing compensation and maximizing extrinsic n-type doping. However, we note that the single-phase regions for the ABX4 phases are relatively narrow, suggesting that the speciﬁc choice of chemical potentials has only a minor eﬀect.\\n', ' In Figure 3a−c, the defect formation enthalpy (ΔHD,q) is calculated as a function of the Fermi energy (EF), which is referenced to the valence band maximum and ranges from 0 to the band gap energy (Eg). For the defect calculations, the band gaps were calculated with a higher-accuracy many-body GW- based methods (see Methods section). The equilibrium Fermi energy can be calculated by self-consistently solving for charge neutrality between the charged defects and free carriers. To the ﬁrst order, the intersection of the lowest-energy acceptors and donors. In all three systems, the lowest-charged defects are the alkali metal vacancies VK,Rb,Cs (red) and the SbGa (brown) antisite donor defect. In each of the three Zintl phases (KGaSb4, RbGaSb4, CsGaSb4), we ﬁnd that the equilibrium Fermi energy lies roughly in the middle of the gap, which is consistent with the observed intrinsic nature of the undoped phases.\\n', ' the equilibrium Fermi energy lies near\\n', ' The dopability of a semiconductor is quantiﬁed by the achievable carrier type(s) and concentrations. It depends on several factors, including (1) the formation energetics of native defects, and (2) the existence of dopants with suﬃcient solubility and desired electronic properties. The former depends on the formation energy of the lowest-energy native acceptor and donor defects. Materials with low formation energy acceptors (e.g., alkali vacancies) are diﬃcult to dope n- type due to defect compensation. In this context, n-type\\n', ' 2186\\n', ' Figure 4. Extrinsic doping of RbGaSb4 used as a demonstration of extrinsic doping in the ABX4 compounds. Formation enthalpies (ΔHD,q) are calculated under conditions that maximize the chemical potential (and solubility) of the dopant species. The vertical dashed line shows the equilibrium Fermi energy at 823 K (growth temperature of RbGaSb4). (a) Consistent with experiment, Ba-doped RbGaSb4 should be n-type. (b) Lithium should also behave as a weak n-type dopant, although the eﬀectiveness is decreased in comparison to Ba. (c) The inﬂuence of Te-doping highlights some interesting secondary eﬀects; while TeSb defects are low-energy, calculating the diagram in the Te-rich regime dramatically changes VRb compensation.\\n', ' dopability can be gauged from the energy “window” created at the conduction band minimum by the lowest-energy native acceptor defect. In Figure 3a−c, the n-type dopability window is denoted by ΔEDon.\\n', ' In Figure 3, KGaSb4 has the largest ΔEDon (∼0.6 eV), followed by RbGaSb4 (∼0.4 eV) and CsGaSb4 (∼0.3 eV). The reduced ΔEDon in CsGaSb4 can be partly attributed to the widened band gap (compared to KGaSb4) and the associated lowering of the cation vacancy formation energy. Thus, while RbGaSb4 and CsGaSb4 are still n-type dopable, they are probably less dopable when compared to KGaSb4. As referenced before, however, the ultimate dopability also depends on ﬁnding a suitable low-energy dopant that has suﬃcient solubility. To examine the action of some intuitive let us speciﬁcally consider dopants in the ABX4 phases, extrinsic doping of RbGaSb4.\\n', ' For RbGaSb4, we computationally assessed three plausible n- type dopants: BaRb, Lii, and TeSb. For completeness, we consider all possible substitutions in our calculations (e.g., Ba could substitute as BaRb, BaGa, or BaSb). In the case of interstitial Li, the position of the Li interstitial is determined using a Voronoi tessellation scheme as implemented in the pylada-defects software.63 The resulting defect energetics for Ba-doping, Li-doping, and Te-doping are shown in Figure 4a− c, respectively. For each case, the chemical potential conditions are chosen to maximize the chemical potential of the dopant (subsequently maximizing dopant solubility) while maintaining phase stability of RbGaSb4. Note that when considering an extrinsic dopant, the phase stability region of RbGaSb4 must be recalculated in the Rb−Ga−Sb-dopant phase space. Any additional competing phases that involve the dopant species must be considered in re-establishing the single-phase region of RbGaSb4.\\n', ' For Ba-doping (Figure 4a), BaRb is the most favorable dopant defect, as expected. The equilibrium Fermi energy calculated at 550 °C (growth temperature) is shown with a dashed vertical line, which lies close to the intersection of the lowest-energy acceptor (VRb) and donor (BaRb). Since the\\n', ' Fermi energy is set closer to the conduction band, Ba-doped RbGaSb4 is predicted to be doped n-type, in agreement with experiment. Although less favorable than BaRb, lithium (Figure 4b) should lightly dope RbGaSb4 n-type. However, the practical doping eﬃciency in Li-doped RbGaSb4 may suﬀer due to the relatively low energy of LiRb neutral defects. The case of Te-doping (Figure 4c) is perhaps the most interesting case. Here, despite substitutional TeSb being a favorable n-type defect (resembling the case of Lii), the Fermi energy has been pushed into the lightly doped p-type regime. As an anion, maximizing the Te chemical potential ultimately pushes the system into a cation-poor regime. As a consequence, compensation by rubidium vacancies is sharply increased, and the material becomes p-type. We also note that the formation enthalpy of TeSb shows strong site dependence, increasing as we transition from TeSb1, TeSb2, TeSb3, and TeSb4. Our calculations support that (1) undoped RbGaSb4 and CsGaSb4 are intrinsic, and (2) RbGaSb4 and CsGaSb4 can be extrinsically doped n-type. These results are in excellent agreement with experiments. More importantly, the calcu- lations have revealed the reason for the strong changes in carrier concentration among KGaSb4, RbGaSb4, and CsGaSb4. It is unlikely that Ba-doping alone will achieve the degenerate n-type doping that is needed to optimize the thermoelectric performance in RbGaSb4 or CsGaSb4. Future studies will consider a more exhaustive set of n-type dopants for RbGaSb4 and CsGaSb4. For example, interstitial dopants, and Ga-site dopants are several unexplored possibilities.\\n', ' rare-earth metals,\\n', ' Experimental Thermal Properties of ABX4 Zintls. The defect energetics and Ba-doping eﬀectiveness in KGaSb4, RbGaSb4, and CsGaSb4 showed a strong dependence on the alkali metal cation despite minor changes in the crystal structure. The addition of heavier cations could be reasonably expected to have a strong inﬂuence on the thermal conductivity as well. Generally, the Zintl phases tend to have intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity owing to their complex structures, soft bonding, and heavy elements.2,3\\n', ' 2187\\n', ' However, the defect energetics and dopability of KGaSb4, RbGaSb4, and CsGaSb4 showed a strong dependence on the alkali metal cation despite relatively minor changes in the crystal structure.

Here we present a brief comparison of the thermal properties of the Ga-based ABX4 Zintls.\\n', ' To reduce the eﬀect of bipolar contributions, we elected to measure the thermal properties of the Ba-doped samples. Polycrystalline pellets of KGaSb4, RbGaSb4, and CsGaSb4 were measured up to 350 °C on both heating and cooling. Sample densities are consistently >97% of the theoretical densities predicted by X-ray diﬀraction. The total thermal conductivity is included in the Supporting Information, Figure S8. To separate the electronic contribution, the Wiedemann−Franz e = LT/ρ) was used to calculate the lattice thermal law (κ conductivity (κ e). In our previous work, we used the high-temperature Seebeck coeﬃcient data to explicitly calculate the Lorenz number L at each temperature. However, Seebeck measurements are unreliable for RbGaSb4 and CsGaSb4 due to the relatively low carrier concentrations. As such, the Lorenz number was approximated as 2.44 × 10−8 W Ω K−2. Regardless, the high resistivity of RbGaSb4 and CsGaSb4 renders the electronic contribution fairly insignif- icant. Figure 5 demonstrates the resulting lattice thermal conductivity for KGaSb4, RbGaSb4, and CsGaSb4.\\n', ' l = κ − κ\\n', ' Figure 5. Lattice thermal conductivity values for Ba-doped samples of KGaSb4, RbGaSb4, and CsGaSb4 are exceptionally low. By 350 °C, all materials are below 0.5 W m−1 K−1 and are quickly nearing the glassy limit approximated by the Debye−Callaway model. The similarity between the compounds is striking, considering the signiﬁcant diﬀerence in mass between K and Cs. There may be a small portion of the high-temperature lattice thermal conductivity that includes a bipolar component due to the modest n-type doping of the Rb and Cs compounds.\\n', ' All three materials possess extraordinarily low lattice thermal conductivity, reaching <0.5 W m−1 K−1 by 350 °C. These values are not far from the optical phonon dominated “glassy limit” (κ Min) as approximated by the Debye−Callaway model. ∼ For KGaSb4, the theoretical minimum is approximately κ 0.37 W m−1 K−1 (gray dashed line). Perhaps the more surprising conclusion is the similarity among the three materials, which are functionally identical within error. We suspect that the Sb-framework must drive the majority of the thermal transport; the acoustic branches in particular should\\n', ' Min\\n', ' have strong Sb-character due to Sb’s heavy mass. This is reﬂected in the minimal impact of KGaSb4 −KAlSb4 alloying in our prior work.46 Likewise, it appears that the choice of alkali metal has a limited role in the thermal conductivity. It would be interesting, however, to alloy with signiﬁcantly smaller ions. For example, incorporation of Li (as suggested in the defect calculations) may be able to contribute as a surrogate “rattler” within the tunnel structures, analogous to the eﬀects observed in the clathrates.\\n', ' Predicted TE Performance of ABX4 Zintl Phases. Our previous studies revealed that KAlSb4 and KGaSb4 are excellent candidates for thermoelectrics due to their extremely low lattice thermal conductivity and high electron mobi- lity.46,47 The new additions to the ABX4 family, RbAlSb4, RbGaSb4, CsAlSb4, and CsGaSb4, also show potential. However, we have also shown that the critical parameter, the dopability, can change dramatically with choice of the alkali metal cation. To this end, exploring other reasonable ABX4 combinations (particularly those with smaller band gaps) would be valuable. To this end, we evaluated 21 hypothetical ABX4 compounds along with the 6 experimentally realized phases using DFT calculations. In total, 27 ABX4 phases were evaluated, corresponding to all combinations of A = (K, Rb, Cs), B = (Al, Ga, In), and X = (As, Sb, Bi). All 27 phases retain the prototype ABX4 structure upon DFT relaxation. Of the 27 compounds, 21 exhibit nonzero DFT (GGA-PBE) band gaps; for these phases, we assess their n- and p-type thermoelectric performance with the thermoelectric quality factor β (see Methods section). The results for these 21 compounds are presented in Table 1.\\n', ' n and β\\n', ' n values.

However, the presence of the 2−2−3 structure is not necessarily at odds with formation of the 1−1−4 structure, as the K−Ga−Sb system also shows a corresponding 2−2−3.

All four new phases are structural analogues of KAlSb4 and KGaSb4, previously demonstrated as promising n-type thermoelectric materials (zT ∼ 1, 350−400 °C). We examined structural trends in the ABX4 family of Zintl materials, highlighting the inﬂuence of the alkali metal cation (K, Rb, Cs) on the structure. Our experimental work focused primarily on the Ga- containing antimonides, drawing comparisons between the K-, Rb-, and Cs-containing analogues. We have demonstrated n- type doping of RbGaSb4 and CsGaSb4 with Ba, although the Hall carrier concentrations achieved in these phases are signiﬁcantly lower than in KGaSb4. First-principles defect calculations provided critical insight into the reduced eﬃcacy of Ba in RbGaSb4 and CsGaSb4. As we consider heavier alkali metal cations, the associated alkali metal vacancies become progressively more favorable and hinder n-type doping. However, all materials possess a sizable “dopability window” and should be amenable to extrinsic dopants. Consequently, we also investigated the inﬂuence of extrinsic dopants on the defect energetics, examining the eﬀect of Ba, Li, and Te on RbGaSb4. As expected of a complex Zintl phase, thermal transport remains excellent, falling below <0.5 W m−1 K−1 by 350 °C in RbGaSb4 and CsGaSb4. Considering the strong inﬂuence of chemistry on the dopability, we also performed a computational survey of 27 ABX4 compositions where A = (K, Rb, Cs), B = (Al, Ga, In), and X = (As, Sb, Bi), assessing their transport properties and TE potential.

The manufacturing of an all-Zintl module is particularly attractive for practical applications, as it alleviates concerns regarding the electronic, thermal, and mechanical compatibility of the p- and n-type legs. To date, a large majority of Zintl phases have been realized as p-type TE materials. Our recent discovery of n-type transport in Ba-doped KAlSb4 and KGaSb4 has helped demonstrate the potential of n-type Zintl thermo- electrics. In this paper, we report the experimental discovery of 4 ABX4 Zintl phases: RbAlSb4, RbGaSb4, CsAlSb4, and CsGaSb4. Transport measurements on Ba-doped RbGaSb4 and CsGaSb4 demonstrate near glassy lattice thermal conductivity (<0.5 W m−1 K−1, 350 °C) and lightly doped n-type transport. However, the doping eﬃciency of Ba in RbGaSb4 and CsGaSb4 is signiﬁcantly impeded when compared to our prior work on KGaSb4. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we performed ﬁrst-principles defect calculations and found that the eﬀect of compensating alkali metal vacancies increases in the Rb- and Cs-based analogues. Considering the TE potential of the known ABX4 n-type materials, we have also performed a computational survey over 27 plausible compositions where A = (K, Rb, Cs), B = (Al, Ga, In), and X = (As, Sb, Bi) to investigate the eﬀect of chemistry on potential TE performance. KEYWORDS: n-type Zintl, n-type thermoelectric, defect calculations, doping\\n', '\\n', ' ■ INTRODUCTION\\n', '\\n', ' The discovery of high-performance thermoelectric materials is a complex process, due in part to the interdependent nature of electron and phonon transport processes.1 The same scattering phenomena that create low thermal conductivity often hinder electronic transport and force a reduction in the electronic mobility. A long-standing challenge in thermoelectrics is the discovery of materials that circumvent this paradigm. In this respect, the Zintl phases are uniquely suited for thermoelectric applications.2−4 Despite inherently low (near glassy) lattice thermal conductivity, Zintls often maintain respectable electronic transport. Such a unique prospect has even prompted the concept of the phonon-glass electron-crystal (PGEC) concept within thermoelectrics.5\\n', '\\n', ' Zintl phases have been recognized as a promising class of thermoelectric materials since the 1990s. Many technologically relevant thermoelectrics are Zintl phases, whose structural diversity can range from the clathrates (e.g., Ba8Ga16Ge30),6−15 interstitially ﬁlled skutterudites (e.g., CeCo4Sb12)16−25 and complex rare-earth/alkali-earth-containing networks (e.g., Yb14MnSb11).26−36 The continued success of these materials has culminated in the development of Zintl-based radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTG) for deep-space power applications.37 However, the design of eﬀective and reliable\\n', '\\n', ' modules depends heavily on the chemical, mechanical, and electrical compatibility of the diﬀerent thermoelectric seg- ments. A persistent problem has been the relative scarcity of n- type Zintl compounds, as the vast majority of Zintl materials present as p-type semiconductors. Computational searches for high-eﬃciency n-type thermoelectric materials have historically neglected dopability metrics. Subsequently, computational predictions have often been challenging to realize exper- imentally (e.g., LiZnSb).38,39 Recent computational studies even suggest that the majority of the well-studied Zintl phases may be fated to exhibit p-type transport regardless of doping or growth conditions.40 Even the advent of phase-boundary mapping41−44 may be powerless to realize equilibrium n-type transport in many of the Zintl materials due to the facile formation of alkali and alkali earth metal vacancies.

Our discovery of n-type transport and good performance (zT ∼ 1, 350−400 °C) in Ba-doped KAlSb4 and Ba-doped KGaSb4 helped to demonstrate the potential of other n-type Zintl phases.46,47 Despite being discovered in the early 1990s, these materials had seen little characterization eﬀorts beyond X-ray diﬀraction.49,50\\n', '\\n', ' In this work, we present the experimental discovery of four new Zintl materials, RbAlSb4, RbGaSb4, CsAlSb4, and CsGaSb4. The materials were synthesized as polycrystalline powders and characterized via high-resolution synchrotron X- ray diﬀraction. Structures were solved from the powder patterns using charge ﬂipping methods and were found to be isostructural to KAlSb4 and KGaSb4. Rietveld reﬁnements trends between ABX4 allowed us to compare structural compounds with varying alkali (K, Rb, Cs) and group 13 (Al, Ga) atoms. For transport measurements, we chose to concentrate on the Ga-series of compounds, although we expect results to generalize to the Al-based analogues. Similar to our work on KGaSb4, we doped samples of KGaSb4, RbGaSb4, and CsGaSb4 with 2.5% Ba, ﬁnding that all materials are n-type dopable. However, the Hall carrier concentration decreases signiﬁcantly between KGaSb4 (1019 e− cm−3), RbGaSb4 (1018 e− cm−3), and CsGaSb4 (1017 e− cm−3). Subsequent density functional theory calculations reveal that the formation of compensating alkali metal vacancies becomes increasingly favorable as the alkali metal transitions from K, Rb, and Cs, corroborating experimental Hall eﬀect measure- ments. While the thermal conductivity of the Ga-containing ABX4 Zintls remains exceptionally low (<0.5 W m−1 K−1, 350 °C), the variation in doping eﬃciency inspired us to consider alternate (hypothetical) compounds. To this end, we performed a computational survey over 27 ABX4 compositions where A = (K, Rb, Cs), B = (Al, Ga, In), and X = (As, Sb, Bi).

Due to the reactivity of alkali metal precursors, all sample preparation was performed in a nitrogen glovebox (oxygen <3 ppm, water <1 ppm). Elemental reagents were sealed into tungsten carbide vials and ball milled for 90 min in a Spex 8000D high-energy ball mill. Note that an additional 5% excess alkali metal was added to each synthesis (e.g., K1.05GaSb4). Synthesis of Ba- doped samples followed an identical procedure, except for the addition of 2.5% Ba (ingot, Alfa 99.8%) before milling.

These phases were initially identiﬁed from laboratory X-ray diﬀraction, although we performed follow-up measurements at the Advanced Photon Source (APS 11-BM) for conﬁrmation. As internal references, we also included fresh samples of KGaSb4 and KAlSb4 in our experiments. Direct structure solution using charge ﬂipping methods conﬁrms that RbAlSb4, RbGaSb4, CsAlSb4, and CsGaSb4 crystallize in the KAlSb4 structure type.

The tunnel walls are tiled in a herringbone-like pattern (Pnma space group) in the ac-plane. The AlSb/GaSb polyanionic framework contains four unique Sb sites and three unique types of Sb coordination. Extending as inﬁnite chains into the page, we ﬁnd (1) AlSb4/GaSb4 corner-sharing tetrahedra, (2) Sb−Sb zigzag chains, and (3) Sb−Sb trigonal pyramidal chains.

Many peaks display slight asymmetry or shoulder peaks which cannot be modeled by microstructural or fundamental parameter peak shapes. The pattern appears as though two slightly diﬀerent lattice parameters are present for a single compound. An exhaustive search for a new space group or crystal system yielded no results that outperform the original prototype. Changes in processing had a minimal eﬀect on the anomaly, and the eﬀect persisted between batches synthesized independently. Calibration standards from APS conﬁrm no beamline issues, and reﬂections cannot be ascribed to impurities. We suspect that ABX4 powders are more reactive than they initially appear. While samples were synthesized entirely under nitrogen, transport to APS was performed in sealed Kapton capillaries. Spurious oxidation of samples would vary depending on Kapton permeability and seal quality. For this data set, KAlSb4, KGaSb4, RbAlSb4, CsAlSb4, and CsGaSb4 show a minimal eﬀect and need no special attention. RbGaSb4 shows signiﬁcant peak asymmetry and requires additional ﬁtting; details can be found alongside Figure S4. The anomaly does not aﬀect the conclusions derived from the diﬀraction data and would not be resolved outside of synchrotron sources. Considering that KAlSb4 and KGaSb4 showed potential as n- type Zintl thermoelectrics, the next natural step is to dope the new ABX4 materials and determine their amenability to n-type doping.\\n', '\\n', ' Experimental Doping of ABX4 Zintls with Ba.

Geometrically, this causes a signiﬁcant increase in the cross-sectional area of the tunnel structure.

From KGaSb4 (774.06 Å3, a = 10.347 Å, b = 4.201 Å, c = 17.807 Å) to RbGaSb4 (808.15 Å3, a = 10.525 Å, b = 4.210 Å, c = 18.104 Å), the a- and c-directions expand approximately 1.7% whereas the b-direction expands only by 0.2%. Similarly, for the transition between RbGaSb4 and CsGaSb4 (836.07 Å3, a = 10.742 Å, b = 4.219 Å, c = 18.448 Å), the a-direction expands 2.1%; c expands 1.9%, and b expands only 0.2%.

This agrees well with the present study, where Ba-doped KGaSb4 saturates near 1.1 × 1019 e− cm−3 at 350 °C. The reduced temperatures in this work are to avoid sublimation of RbGaSb4 and CsGaSb4 at high temperatures. The qualitative trend for KGaSb4 also tracks our previous publication well, showing a Hall carrier concentration that decreases with temperature. We do not observe any hysteresis during thermal cycling of the ABX4 samples below 350 °C, so we do not suspect permanent loss of the alkali metal as a contributing factor to the decreasing carrier concentration. Instead, this observation may be explained by the thermal activation of compensating defects (e.g., alkali metal vacancies), nonparabolicity of the bands, or energy-dependent electron scattering rates that evolve with temperature.\\n', '\\n', ' The electronic resistivity exhibits two eﬀects: (1) increasing resistivity due to decreased doping eﬃciency moving from KGaSb4, RbGaSb4, to CsGaSb4, and (2) decreasing resistivity with temperature.

To provide insight into the n-type dopability of KGaSb4, RbGaSb4, and CsGaSb4, we turn to ﬁrst-principles defect calculations. Focusing on the native defects, Figure 3a−c summarizes the calculated defect formation enthalpies. For consistency, all calculations were performed under alkali-rich conditions. While the alkali metal chemical potential is maximized, the formation of alkali vacancies is suppressed, which is conducive for minimizing compensation and maximizing extrinsic n-type doping. However, we note that the single-phase regions for the ABX4 phases are relatively narrow, suggesting that the speciﬁc choice of chemical potentials has only a minor eﬀect.\\n', '\\n', ' In Figure 3a−c, the defect formation enthalpy (ΔHD,q) is calculated as a function of the Fermi energy (EF), which is referenced to the valence band maximum and ranges from 0 to the band gap energy (Eg).

In Figure 3a−c, the n-type dopability window is denoted by ΔEDon.\\n', '\\n', ' In Figure 3, KGaSb4 has the largest ΔEDon (∼0.6 eV), followed by RbGaSb4 (∼0.4 eV) and CsGaSb4 (∼0.3 eV). The reduced ΔEDon in CsGaSb4 can be partly attributed to the widened band gap (compared to KGaSb4) and the associated lowering of the cation vacancy formation energy. Thus, while RbGaSb4 and CsGaSb4 are still n-type dopable, they are probably less dopable when compared to KGaSb4. As referenced before, however, the ultimate dopability also depends on ﬁnding a suitable low-energy dopant that has suﬃcient solubility. To examine the action of some intuitive let us speciﬁcally consider dopants in the ABX4 phases, extrinsic doping of RbGaSb4.\\n', '\\n', ' For RbGaSb4, we computationally assessed three plausible n- type dopants: BaRb, Lii, and TeSb. For completeness, we consider all possible substitutions in our calculations (e.g., Ba could substitute as BaRb, BaGa, or BaSb). In the case of interstitial Li, the position of the Li interstitial is determined using a Voronoi tessellation scheme as implemented in the pylada-defects software.63 The resulting defect energetics for Ba-doping, Li-doping, and Te-doping are shown in Figure 4a− c, respectively. For each case, the chemical potential conditions are chosen to maximize the chemical potential of the dopant (subsequently maximizing dopant solubility) while maintaining phase stability of RbGaSb4. Note that when considering an extrinsic dopant, the phase stability region of RbGaSb4 must be recalculated in the Rb−Ga−Sb-dopant phase space. Any additional competing phases that involve the dopant species must be considered in re-establishing the single-phase region of RbGaSb4.\\n', '\\n', ' For Ba-doping (Figure 4a), BaRb is the most favorable dopant defect, as expected. The equilibrium Fermi energy calculated at 550 °C (growth temperature) is shown with a dashed vertical line, which lies close to the intersection of the lowest-energy acceptor (VRb) and donor (BaRb). Since the\\n', '\\n', ' Fermi energy is set closer to the conduction band, Ba-doped RbGaSb4 is predicted to be doped n-type, in agreement with experiment. Although less favorable than BaRb, lithium (Figure 4b) should lightly dope RbGaSb4 n-type. However, the practical doping eﬃciency in Li-doped RbGaSb4 may suﬀer due to the relatively low energy of LiRb neutral defects. The case of Te-doping (Figure 4c) is perhaps the most interesting case. Here, despite substitutional TeSb being a favorable n-type defect (resembling the case of Lii), the Fermi energy has been pushed into the lightly doped p-type regime. As an anion, maximizing the Te chemical potential ultimately pushes the system into a cation-poor regime. As a consequence, compensation by rubidium vacancies is sharply increased, and the material becomes p-type. We also note that the formation enthalpy of TeSb shows strong site dependence, increasing as we transition from TeSb1, TeSb2, TeSb3, and TeSb4. Our calculations support that (1) undoped RbGaSb4 and CsGaSb4 are intrinsic, and (2) RbGaSb4 and CsGaSb4 can be extrinsically doped n-type. These results are in excellent agreement with experiments. More importantly, the calcu- lations have revealed the reason for the strong changes in carrier concentration among KGaSb4, RbGaSb4, and CsGaSb4. It is unlikely that Ba-doping alone will achieve the degenerate n-type doping that is needed to optimize the thermoelectric performance in RbGaSb4 or CsGaSb4. Future studies will consider a more exhaustive set of n-type dopants for RbGaSb4 and CsGaSb4.

In our previous work, we used the high-temperature Seebeck coeﬃcient data to explicitly calculate the Lorenz number L at each temperature.

First-principles defect calculations provided critical insight into the reduced eﬃcacy of Ba in RbGaSb4 and CsGaSb4. As we consider heavier alkali metal cations, the associated alkali metal vacancies become progressively more favorable and hinder n-type doping. However, all materials possess a sizable “dopability window” and should be amenable to extrinsic dopants. Consequently, we also investigated the inﬂuence of extrinsic dopants on the defect energetics, examining the eﬀect of Ba, Li, and Te on RbGaSb4. As expected of a complex Zintl phase, thermal transport remains excellent, falling below <0.5 W m−1 K−1 by 350 °C in RbGaSb4 and CsGaSb4. Considering the strong inﬂuence of chemistry on the dopability, we also performed a computational survey of 27 ABX4 compositions where A = (K, Rb, Cs), B = (Al, Ga, In), and X = (As, Sb, Bi), assessing their transport properties and TE potential. Ultimately, our work has demonstrated the experimental realization of four new\\n', '\\n', ' materials, demonstrated their potential as n-type TE materials, and tripled the number of known compounds in the ABX4 family of Zintl phases.\\n', '\\n', ' ■ ASSOCIATED CONTENT\\n', '\\n', ' *sı Supporting Information The Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsaem.0c00048.\\n', '\\n', ' Additional diﬀraction, structural, and transport data (PDF)\\n', '\\n', ' ■ AUTHOR INFORMATION\\n', '\\n', ' Corresponding Authors\\n', '\\n', ' Brenden R.

      " In this work, we present the experimental discovery of four new Zintl materials, RbAlSb4, RbGaSb4, CsAlSb4, and CsGaSb4. The materials were synthesized as polycrystalline powders and characterized via high-resolution synchrotron X- ray diﬀraction. Structures were solved from the powder patterns using charge ﬂipping methods and were found to be isostructural to KAlSb4 and KGaSb4. Rietveld reﬁnements trends between ABX4 allowed us to compare structural compounds with varying alkali (K, Rb, Cs) and group 13 (Al, Ga) atoms. For transport measurements, we chose to concentrate on the Ga-series of compounds, although we expect results to generalize to the Al-based analogues. Similar to our work on KGaSb4, we doped samples of KGaSb4, RbGaSb4, and CsGaSb4 with 2.5% Ba, ﬁnding that all materials are n-type dopable. However, the Hall carrier concentration decreases signiﬁcantly between KGaSb4 (1019 e− cm−3), RbGaSb4 (1018 e− cm−3), and CsGaSb4 (1017 e− cm−3). Subsequent density functional theory calculations reveal that the formation of compensating alkali metal vacancies becomes increasingly favorable as the alkali metal transitions from K, Rb, and Cs, corroborating experimental Hall eﬀect measure- ments. While the thermal conductivity of the Ga-containing ABX4 Zintls remains exceptionally low (<0.5 W m−1 K−1, 350 °C), the variation in doping eﬃciency inspired us to consider alternate (hypothetical) compounds. To this end, we performed a computational survey over 27 ABX4 compositions where A = (K, Rb, Cs), B = (Al, Ga, In), and X = (As, Sb, Bi).

      " ABSTRACT: Zintl phases are excellent candidates for high-eﬃciency thermoelectrics (TEs) due to their extremely low lattice thermal conductivity. The manufacturing of an all-Zintl module is particularly attractive for practical applications, as it alleviates concerns regarding the electronic, thermal, and mechanical compatibility of the p- and n-type legs. To date, a large majority of Zintl phases have been realized as p-type TE materials. Our recent discovery of n-type transport in Ba-doped KAlSb4 and KGaSb4 has helped demonstrate the potential of n-type Zintl thermo- electrics. In this paper, we report the experimental discovery of 4 ABX4 Zintl phases: RbAlSb4, RbGaSb4, CsAlSb4, and CsGaSb4. Transport measurements on Ba-doped RbGaSb4 and CsGaSb4 demonstrate near glassy lattice thermal conductivity (<0.5 W m−1 K−1, 350 °C) and lightly doped n-type transport. However, the doping eﬃciency of Ba in RbGaSb4 and CsGaSb4 is signiﬁcantly impeded when compared to our prior work on KGaSb4. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we performed ﬁrst-principles defect calculations and found that the eﬀect of compensating alkali metal vacancies increases in the Rb- and Cs-based analogues. Considering the TE potential of the known ABX4 n-type materials, we have also performed a computational survey over 27 plausible compositions where A = (K, Rb, Cs), B = (Al, Ga, In), and X = (As, Sb, Bi) to investigate the eﬀect of chemistry on potential TE performance.
