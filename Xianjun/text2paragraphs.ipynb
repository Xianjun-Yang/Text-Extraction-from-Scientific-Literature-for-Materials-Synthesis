      " Expanding the library of known inorganic materials with functional electronic or magnetic behavior is a long-standing goal in condensed matter physics and materials science. Recently, the transition metal chalcogenides including selenium and sulfur have been of interest because of their correlated-electron properties, as seen in the iron-based superconductors and the transition metal dichalcogenides. However, the chalcogenide chemical space is less explored than that of oxides, and there is an open question of whether there may be new materials heretofore undiscovered. We perform a systematic combined theoretical and experimental search over ternary phase diagrams that are empty in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database containing cations, transition metals, and one of selenium or sulfur. In these 27 ternary systems, we use a probabilistic model to reduce the likelihood of false negative predictions, which results in a list of 24 candidate materials. We then conduct a variety of synthesis experiments to check the candidate materials for stability. While the prediction method did obtain previously unknown compositions that are predicted stable within density functional theory, none of the candidate materials formed in our experiments. We come to the conclusion that these phase diagrams are “empty” in the case of bulk synthesis, but it remains a possibility that alternate synthesis routes may produce some of these phases.\n",

      " In the last decade or so, high-throughput searches for new materials have been gaining increasing interest as novel and rapid routes to ﬁnd stable compounds. Spurred by the increas- ing availability of large-scale computational resources as well as the rise of a number of materials databases, it has emerged as a rapidly evolving ﬁeld of materials science [1]. There already exist a number of computational materials repositories, including the Materials Project [2], AFLOW library [3], Open Quantum Materials Database [4], Computational Materials Repository [5], and Electronic Structure Project [6], to name a few. These databases offer opportunities for design and discovery of new materials based on data-mining and machine- learning approaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " In recent years this high-throughput machinery has been employed in a number of studies to search for potentially stable oxides. Using a combination of machine learning and ﬁrst- principles calculations, Hautier and coworkers have explored the possibility of ﬁnding “nature’s missing ternary oxides” [7]. High-throughput ab initio computations have also been used to evaluate another class of oxygen-based compounds, namely phosphates, as lithium-ion battery cathodes [8]. A systematic experimental investigation of high-throughput theoretical pre- dictions and their structural characterization, which serves to validate the computational results, has also been performed for alkali carbonophosphate compounds [9]. A computational search for p-type transparent conducting oxides has also been undertaken [10]. Very recently, Cu, Ag, and Au ternary oxides have been identiﬁed using a high-throughput search based on the minima-hopping method [11].\n",

      " In our searched chemical space of chosen cations and 3d transition metals, more than 2300 oxides are listed in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD), whereas only around 350 selenides and sulﬁdes have been reported. While signiﬁcant effort has been devoted to high-throughput\n",
      "\n",

      " searches for oxides, comparatively little is known about the missing selenides and sulﬁdes, and whether they might exist in as-yet empty ternary phases. In this contribution we take a ﬁrst step along this direction for a number of ternary 3d transition metal selenides and sulﬁdes, by identifying, in silico, which of these can be stable. Using a data-mining-based ionic substitution model, in conjunction with density functional theory computations, we study ternary systems of the form XYZ, where the cation X = Ba, Ca, Sr, La, K, Bi, Pb; Y is a 3d transition metal; and Z = S or Se. There are 27 empty ternary phase diagrams with such a combination of elements. Based on a Bayesian likelihood estimate to minimize false negative predictions, we narrow down the search to 24 candidates. Three of these candidates are very similar to misﬁt structures not present in the ICSD. Our predicted structures are similar, though not identical, to these disordered structures and within the framework of the ionic substitution model we only con- sider ordered structure types. We performed high-throughput experiments to synthesize the remaining candidates, using solid state and gas ﬂow reactions. Our experimental attempts resulted in only binary compounds for these systems. Based on this combined theoretical and experimental study we conclude that the ternary compounds in these 27 phase diagrams are not accessible via standard bulk synthesis methods. Nevertheless, it is important for us to present their predicted proximity to stability, and document our experimental attempts, since other synthesis methods may produce these phases.\n",

      " Once we generated the candidate structures, we followed a multilevel strategy to assess the stability of these structures. The ﬁrst level of ﬁltering is obtained by choosing the 100 candidate structures with highest probabilities assigned by the ionic substitution model. At the next step we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations for these selected candidates using the QUANTUM ESPRESSO package [17]. We used the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) parametrization to the exchange-correlation functional [18]. To replace the core electrons we used Rappe-Rabe-Kaxiras-Joannopoulos relativistic ultrasoft pseudopotentials [19]. All the candidate structures were relaxed until the forces on atoms were less than 0.01 eV/ ˚A and the pressure was less than 0.5 kbar. Other computational parameters were chosen following the materials project, which have been shown to lead to total energies being converged to less than 5 meV/atom [20]. For all calculations, we started with a ferromagnetic initialization of spins. Finally, we constructed the phase diagrams by comparing the total energies for the candidate compounds with all known binaries and elements making up the compound. The total energies of elements and binaries were calculated with our calculation setup consistent with that for the ternaries. We used the tools available in the Python Materials Genomics (PYMATGEN) package to analyze the data [21].\n",

Ultimately, we wish to make a binary deci- sion: we either attempt to synthesize a compound or not, based on the DFT calculations.

The estimates for N0 and α are obtained from ternary phase diagrams in the same chemical space which have known ternary compounds. We used the ionic substitution model and total energy calculations to estimate N0 (cid:5) 5 and α (cid:5) 100 structure/eV. N0 controls the y intercept of Fig. 1, and α partially affects the slope. Since N0 and α are the most uncertain values in this model, we have checked that the results are reasonably robust to their choice as shown in Fig. 1. To demonstrate that our choices are reasonable, we display hull energies for the Sn-Cu-S system from the Materials Project [2] in Fig. 1(b).

      " Estimated probabilities of false positive and false negative identiﬁcations are shown in Fig. 1, with varying cutoff, (cid:6), and a choice of NS = 2 and N0 = 5. To avoid missing new compounds, we would like to minimize the likelihood of false negative predictions and we set (cid:6) = 0.1 eV. However, this means that our false positive rate ends up being quite large, or in other words the true positive rate would be low. For our choice of (cid:6) = 0.1 eV, the probability of true positive predictions is around 0.05–0.1, depending on the values of α and N0. Taking into account the errors associated with the prediction method our model allows us to estimate the false positive and false negative rates associated with our predictions. As we will report later in the paper, our high-throughput experiments ﬁnd 3 out of the predicted 24 candidates to be stable. This ratio is close to our Bayesian estimate of true positive predictions. This good agreement suggests that our Bayesian model provides a reasonable framework to analyze the reliability of the prediction methods. It also provides insight that the inherent uncertainties in DFT energies leads to a high false positive rate, if the cutoff is set so that the false negative rate is low. It also sheds light on the reason behind why many of the DFT- predicted compounds were not synthesized in our experiments.\n",

This ratio is similar to that of the known ternaries with the same constituent elements, where nearly 60 compounds (out of the existing 106 compounds) have a zero band gap. However, PBE is known to underestimate band gaps, and these values should be taken with caution. Among our predicted compounds, 15 have a magnetic moment greater than 0.05 μB per transition metal atom. In the existing ternaries the ratio of ones with magnetic moment is very similar, with nearly 55% of the compounds showing a ﬁnite magnetic moment.

Following these authors, we used the PBE+U method, using U = 5.0 for Cu and U = 3.0 for all other 3d transition metals. A comparison of the hull energies without and with the FERE correction is shown in Fig. 3. For most candidate compounds, the hull energies calculated without and with the correction are close enough to one another that we would not have changed our decision-making process. A pronounced discrepancy appears for Pb2FeSe4 because the FERE correction for Pb has not been reported and we, therefore, did not apply the correction for Pb.\n",

Both these materials show a very similar electronic structure, with Sr to Ca replacement having negligible effects.

In this cat- egory, SrMn4S7 is marginally unstable, being 0.027 eV/atom above the convex hull. It forms a layered structure, with each S atom being shared between three Mn tetrahedra (SrB4O7 structure type) as illustrated in Fig. 2. The densities of states for the compound are shown in the middle panel of Fig. 6, indicating the contribution from both spins at the Fermi level. PDOS plots reveal, however, that near the Fermi level the overlap between the transition metal d states and anion p levels occurs predominantly for the up-spin, while being largely suppressed for the opposite spin. The next compound in this class, Sr2FeSe3, crystallizes in the Eu2CuS3 parent structure type, with Fe atoms forming vertex-sharing tetrahedral chains, and has an inverse hull energy of −0.094 eV/atom. Ba2Sc2S5 lies 0.068 eV/atom above the convex hull and crystallizes in the Sr2Ga2S5 structure type, with Sc atoms being present in a tetrahedral coordination. It has a zero magnetic moment along with a large DFT-PBE band gap of 2.61 eV (Fig. 6). The major- ity of the DOS contribution in the occupied states arises from S p orbitals, with the Sc d orbitals being predominantly empty.\n",

We ﬁnd that these two materials have an interesting layered structure and the layers themselves are interconnected by one-dimensional chains, as shown in Fig. 2. We can see from the density of states that SrV4S7 and SrCr4S7 have ﬁnite overlap of transition metal d states and S p states near the Fermi level for up-spin, while the overlap is much reduced for the down-spin. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that in moving from V to the Cr compound, ﬁlling of the up-spin d states is enhanced, and as a result the magnetic moment increases from 1.51 μB/V to 2.74 μB/Cr. Finally, the last compound in this category, KScS2, has a reasonably large inverse hull energy of −0.136 eV/atom.

The crystal structures are shown in Fig. 2. We obtain the three compounds to be metals within PBE. From the DOS projected onto the transition metal d orbitals and the S anion p orbitals, we see that they have a signiﬁcant d orbital contribution near the Fermi level. Expectedly, the magnetic moment increases as one changes the transition metal going from left to right in the periodic table, i.e., from Ti to V to Mn. We can also infer this from the PDOS of transition metal d states. As we go from Ti to V to Mn, an increasing number of up-spin d states become occupied, resulting in an increasing magnetic moment. It is interesting to observe that a La-Cr-S compound is known to exist in the same NH4CdCl3 structure. It has been found to show intriguing magnetic properties, which are reminiscent of spin-glass behavior [26].

      " based ionic substitution model and ﬁrst-principles density functional theory calculations, we explored several thousand candidate structures and examined them for their stability. Using a Bayesian likelihood model to minimize false negative predictions, we narrowed down the search to 24 candidates. We then carried out high-throughput experiments to attempt synthesis of these compounds using solid state and gas ﬂow reactions. While we found similar compounds to known misﬁt materials, the truly new materials were not found in our experimental synthesis. There are three possible conclusions that result from this study:\n",

Along the theoretical front, future work can include using evolutionary algorithms to ﬁnd other candidate structures in this interesting chemical space and using more accurate electronic structure methods to check the stability of our proposed compounds.\n",

      " The work presented here represents a tight coupling of high- throughput quantum calculations with high-throughput exper- iment and contains several important lessons. We have shown that inherent errors in the density functional are sufﬁcient to explain failures to synthesize structures that are predicted to be stable using density functional theory calculations. Higher ac- curacy calculations such as quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) [36] may be worth the additional computational cost, since they should allow reduction of both the false positive and false negative rates by signiﬁcant margins. However, given that cur- rently our high-throughput synthesis techniques are faster than QMC calculations, it may be more optimal to simply accept a larger false positive rate and utilize experiments to winnow candidates.\n",

      " Thin-ﬁlm deposition can often stabilize phases that are not seen in the bulk due to interfacial effects and control of chemical potential of some sources as well as the fact that synthesis can be carried out at much lower temperatures. Thin ﬁlms of Pb-Fe-Se were grown searching for the predicted composition PbFe2Se3. They exhibited the diffraction pattern shown in Fig. 10. The oriented nature of the sample and the small thickness preclude a meaningful Rietveld ﬁt of the data, but all peaks are accounted for by a combination of PbSe, Fe3Se4, and the Si substrate. No peaks from our predicted ternary Pb-Fe-Se phases PbFe2Se3, Pb2FeSe3, or Pb2FeSe4 nor from FeSe were seen. It is interesting to note that the iron selenide phase that was formed has a larger Se content than FeSe. We have found that this is determined by the Se2 ﬂux from the cracked Se source. Unlike bulk synthesis where the number of Se atoms is determined, in thin-ﬁlm growth the beam composition and ﬂux determines the Se chemical potential. For large ﬂuxes of more reactive molecules the chemical potential is larger and the composition is pushed to large Se content.\n",

Recently, the transition metal chalcogenides including selenium and sulfur have been of interest because of their correlated-electron properties, as seen in the iron-based superconductors and the transition metal dichalcogenides. However, the chalcogenide chemical space is less explored than that of oxides, and there is an open question of whether there may be new materials heretofore undiscovered. We perform a systematic combined theoretical and experimental search over ternary phase diagrams that are empty in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database containing cations, transition metals, and one of selenium or sulfur. In these 27 ternary systems, we use a probabilistic model to reduce the likelihood of false negative predictions, which results in a list of 24 candidate materials. We then conduct a variety of synthesis experiments to check the candidate materials for stability. While the prediction method did obtain previously unknown compositions that are predicted stable within density functional theory, none of the candidate materials formed in our experiments. We come to the conclusion that these phase diagrams are “empty” in the case of bulk synthesis, but it remains a possibility that alternate synthesis routes may produce some of these phases.': 0, ' DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.94.045105': 0, ' I.

Spurred by the increas- ing availability of large-scale computational resources as well as the rise of a number of materials databases, it has emerged as a rapidly evolving ﬁeld of materials science [1]. There already exist a number of computational materials repositories, including the Materials Project [2], AFLOW library [3], Open Quantum Materials Database [4], Computational Materials Repository [5], and Electronic Structure Project [6], to name a few. These databases offer opportunities for design and discovery of new materials based on data-mining and machine- learning approaches.': 0, ' In recent years this high-throughput machinery has been employed in a number of studies to search for potentially stable oxides. Using a combination of machine learning and ﬁrst- principles calculations, Hautier and coworkers have explored the possibility of ﬁnding “nature’s missing ternary oxides” [7]. High-throughput ab initio computations have also been used to evaluate another class of oxygen-based compounds, namely phosphates, as lithium-ion battery cathodes [8]. A systematic experimental investigation of high-throughput theoretical pre- dictions and their structural characterization, which serves to validate the computational results, has also been performed for alkali carbonophosphate compounds [9]. A computational search for p-type transparent conducting oxides has also been undertaken [10]. Very recently, Cu, Ag, and Au ternary oxides have been identiﬁed using a high-throughput search based on the minima-hopping method [11].': 0, ' In our searched chemical space of chosen cations and 3d transition metals, more than 2300 oxides are listed in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD), whereas only around 350 selenides and sulﬁdes have been reported. While signiﬁcant effort has been devoted to high-throughput': 0, ' searches for oxides, comparatively little is known about the missing selenides and sulﬁdes, and whether they might exist in as-yet empty ternary phases. In this contribution we take a ﬁrst step along this direction for a number of ternary 3d transition metal selenides and sulﬁdes, by identifying, in silico, which of these can be stable. Using a data-mining-based ionic substitution model, in conjunction with density functional theory computations, we study ternary systems of the form XYZ, where the cation X = Ba, Ca, Sr, La, K, Bi, Pb; Y is a 3d transition metal; and Z = S or Se. There are 27 empty ternary phase diagrams with such a combination of elements. Based on a Bayesian likelihood estimate to minimize false negative predictions, we narrow down the search to 24 candidates. Three of these candidates are very similar to misﬁt structures not present in the ICSD. Our predicted structures are similar, though not identical, to these disordered structures and within the framework of the ionic substitution model we only con- sider ordered structure types. We performed high-throughput experiments to synthesize the remaining candidates, using solid state and gas ﬂow reactions. Our experimental attempts resulted in only binary compounds for these systems. Based on this combined theoretical and experimental study we conclude that the ternary compounds in these 27 phase diagrams are not accessible via standard bulk synthesis methods. Nevertheless, it is important for us to present their predicted proximity to stability, and document our experimental attempts, since other synthesis methods may produce these phases.': 0, ' II. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS': 0, ' A. Generation of candidate structures': 0, ' We generated structures using the method of Hautier et al.

Feature functions are augmented by weights for substitutions, which are extracted from ternary and quaternary ionic com- pounds in the ICSD [13]. These are used to evaluate the probabilities and assign ranks to the generated structures. In this way, the ionic substitution method can generate likely structural candidates very quickly.': 0, ' In the following we brieﬂy summarize the main features of this model and refer the readers to Ref. [12] for a more detailed exposition. The mathematical formulation of this model begins by representing any compound composed of ions, Xi (i = 1, . . . ,n), as an n component vector:': 0, ' X = (X1,X2, . . . ,Xn).': 0, ' (1)': 0, ' One then requires the probability pn for two different com- pounds having the same number of components to exist in the same crystal structure.

In the ionic substitution model this is achieved by using feature functions, f (X,X(cid:2)), which capture the key aspects of the problem. A mathematical requirement for the feature function is that it should be deﬁned on the domain of the sought probability function and should return either 0 or 1. One can then approximate the probability function as (cid:4) i λifi(X,X(cid:2)) Z': 0, ' pn(X,X(cid:2)) ≈': 0, ' (cid:2)(cid:3)': 0, ' exp': 0, ' (3)': 0, ' ,': 0, ' where λi is the weight corresponding to feature fi(X,X(cid:2)), and Z is analogous to a partition function which ensures normal- ization of the probability function. An implicit assumption is that the feature functions do not depend on the number of ions, n, in the compound; i.e., ionic substitution rules do not depend on n. Then, one assumes that the probability of two ions to replace each other is the same regardless of other ions in the compound. This is implemented by considering only binary feature functions, which read f α,β k': 0, ' = β,': 0, ' (X,X(cid:2)) = 1, Xk = α,X(cid:2) k otherwise.': 0, ' = 0,': 0, ' (4)': 0, ' k': 0, ' Every pair of ions (α,β) is assigned feature functions of the above form. The corresponding weights, λα,β , indicate how likely is the α ↔ β binary substitution. These weights are obtained from the ternary and quaternary ionic compounds in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) [13]. From this database, crystal similarities are then estimated using structure comparison algorithms [14]. Then, one can assign speciﬁc values (x,x(cid:2)) to the vectors (X,X(cid:2)).

[15,16], while they may be preferable in terms of calculating the overall lowest energy structures, would be computationally prohibitive for this study.': 0, ' Once we generated the candidate structures, we followed a multilevel strategy to assess the stability of these structures. The ﬁrst level of ﬁltering is obtained by choosing the 100 candidate structures with highest probabilities assigned by the ionic substitution model. At the next step we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations for these selected candidates using the QUANTUM ESPRESSO package [17]. We used the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) parametrization to the exchange-correlation functional [18]. To replace the core electrons we used Rappe-Rabe-Kaxiras-Joannopoulos relativistic ultrasoft pseudopotentials [19]. All the candidate structures were relaxed until the forces on atoms were less than 0.01 eV/ ˚A and the pressure was less than 0.5 kbar. Other computational parameters were chosen following the materials project, which have been shown to lead to total energies being converged to less than 5 meV/atom [20]. For all calculations, we started with a ferromagnetic initialization of spins. Finally, we constructed the phase diagrams by comparing the total energies for the candidate compounds with all known binaries and elements making up the compound. The total energies of elements and binaries were calculated with our calculation setup consistent with that for the ternaries. We used the tools available in the Python Materials Genomics (PYMATGEN) package to analyze the data [21].': 0, ' B. Decisions based on DFT data': 0, ' Structural phase diagrams require a high degree of accuracy, which DFT calculations do not attain. For example, according to Jain et al. [2], the DFT-calculated hull energies in the searched chemical space are close to normally distributed. Only 40% of the 106 existing ternaries in the searched chemical space lie on the hull. Ultimately, we wish to make a binary deci- sion: we either attempt to synthesize a compound or not, based on the DFT calculations. There are thus two potential errors one can make: false positive, in which a compound is suggested for synthesis and does not form, and false negative, in which a candidate compound is discarded but would have formed.': 0, ' We wish to consider the probability that a single structure is experimentally stable, given that the DFT-calculated enthalpy of formation is (cid:5)H relative to the known and proposed materials in the phase diagram.

NS is the number 0.1 eV. We estimate of experimentally stable structures, while N0 is the number of proposed structures with (cid:5)H < 0. Here the proposed structures are the ones screened by the ionic substitution model. The estimates for N0 and α are obtained from ternary phase diagrams in the same chemical space which have known ternary compounds. We used the ionic substitution model and total energy calculations to estimate N0 (cid:5) 5 and α (cid:5) 100 structure/eV. N0 controls the y intercept of Fig. 1, and α partially affects the slope. Since N0 and α are the most uncertain values in this model, we have checked that the results are reasonably robust to their choice as shown in Fig. 1. To demonstrate that our choices are reasonable, we display hull energies for the Sn-Cu-S system from the Materials Project [2] in Fig. 1(b). Our parameters also agree with extensive cross validation for known phase diagrams in the literature, such as that undertaken by Hautier and coauthors [12].': 0, ' When choosing (cid:6), we need to consider both the false': 0, ' positive rate,': 0, ' P (NS|(cid:5)H < (cid:6)) = P ((cid:5)H < (cid:6)|NS)P (NS)': 0, ' P ((cid:5)H < (cid:6)) = 1 − P (S|(cid:5)H < (cid:6)),': 0, ' and the false negative rate,': 0, ' P ((cid:5)H > (cid:6)|S) = [1 − P ((cid:5)H < (cid:6)|S)].': 0, ' (8)': 0, ' (9)': 0, ' Estimated probabilities of false positive and false negative identiﬁcations are shown in Fig. 1, with varying cutoff, (cid:6), and a choice of NS = 2 and N0 = 5. To avoid missing new compounds, we would like to minimize the likelihood of false negative predictions and we set (cid:6) = 0.1 eV. However, this means that our false positive rate ends up being quite large, or in other words the true positive rate would be low. For our choice of (cid:6) = 0.1 eV, the probability of true positive predictions is around 0.05–0.1, depending on the values of α and N0. Taking into account the errors associated with the prediction method our model allows us to estimate the false positive and false negative rates associated with our predictions. As we will report later in the paper, our high-throughput experiments ﬁnd 3 out of the predicted 24 candidates to be stable. This ratio is close to our Bayesian estimate of true positive predictions. This good agreement suggests that our Bayesian model provides a reasonable framework to analyze the reliability of the prediction methods. It also provides insight that the inherent uncertainties in DFT energies leads to a high false positive rate, if the cutoff is set so that the false negative rate is low. It also sheds light on the reason behind why many of the DFT- predicted compounds were not synthesized in our experiments.': 0, ' III.

This ratio is similar to that of the known ternaries with the same constituent elements, where nearly 60 compounds (out of the existing 106 compounds) have a zero band gap. However, PBE is known to underestimate band gaps, and these values should be taken with caution. Among our predicted compounds, 15 have a magnetic moment greater than 0.05 μB per transition metal atom. In the existing ternaries the ratio of ones with magnetic moment is very similar, with nearly 55% of the compounds showing a ﬁnite magnetic moment.

We use the ﬁtted elemental-phase reference energy (FERE) correction proposed by Stevanovic et al. [24]. Following these authors, we used the PBE+U method, using U = 5.0 for Cu and U = 3.0 for all other 3d transition metals. A comparison of the hull energies without and with the FERE correction is shown in Fig. 3. For most candidate compounds, the hull energies calculated without and with the correction are close enough to one another that we would not have changed our decision-making process. A pronounced discrepancy appears for Pb2FeSe4 because the FERE correction for Pb has not been reported and we, therefore, did not apply the correction for Pb.': 0, ' Varying the chemical potentials of different constituent elements provides an additional control knob and allows one to stabilize different compositions in the phase diagram [25].

From the DOS projected onto the transition metal d orbitals and the S anion p orbitals, we see that they have a signiﬁcant d orbital contribution near the Fermi level. Expectedly, the magnetic moment increases as one changes the transition metal going from left to right in the periodic table, i.e., from Ti to V to Mn. We can also infer this from the PDOS of transition metal d states. As we go from Ti to V to Mn, an increasing number of up-spin d states become occupied, resulting in an increasing magnetic moment. It is interesting to observe that a La-Cr-S compound is known to exist in the same NH4CdCl3 structure.

We have shown that inherent errors in the density functional are sufﬁcient to explain failures to synthesize structures that are predicted to be stable using density functional theory calculations. Higher ac- curacy calculations such as quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) [36] may be worth the additional computational cost, since they should allow reduction of both the false positive and false negative rates by signiﬁcant margins. However, given that cur- rently our high-throughput synthesis techniques are faster than QMC calculations, it may be more optimal to simply accept a larger false positive rate and utilize experiments to winnow candidates.': 0, ' ACKNOWLEDGMENTS': 0, ' We acknowledge support from the Center for Emergent Superconductivity, an Energy Frontier Research Center funded by the US Department of Energy, Ofﬁce of Science, Ofﬁce of Basic Energy Sciences, under Award No. DEAC0298CH1088.

Pb-Fe-Se': 0, ' Thin-ﬁlm deposition can often stabilize phases that are not seen in the bulk due to interfacial effects and control of chemical potential of some sources as well as the fact that synthesis can be carried out at much lower temperatures. Thin ﬁlms of Pb-Fe-Se were grown searching for the predicted composition PbFe2Se3. They exhibited the diffraction pattern shown in Fig. 10. The oriented nature of the sample and the small thickness preclude a meaningful Rietveld ﬁt of the data, but all peaks are accounted for by a combination of PbSe, Fe3Se4, and the Si substrate. No peaks from our predicted ternary Pb-Fe-Se phases PbFe2Se3, Pb2FeSe3, or Pb2FeSe4 nor from FeSe were seen. It is interesting to note that the iron selenide phase that was formed has a larger Se content than FeSe. We have found that this is determined by the Se2 ﬂux from the cracked Se source. Unlike bulk synthesis where the number of Se atoms is determined, in thin-ﬁlm growth the beam composition and ﬂux determines the Se chemical potential. For large ﬂuxes of more reactive molecules the chemical potential is larger and the composition is pushed to large Se content.': 0, ' V.
